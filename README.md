## UNDERGRADUATES, Using Gen AI to Learn Anything
The first steps in successful engagement with a GPT is to have it take on the persona of a prompt engineer. This is a strategic approach to develop or refine prompts and provides users with a valuable learning experience, creative inspiration, and practical insights into the art of crafting effective prompts. This approach combines the AI's capabilities with your knowledge, offering a unique and engaging way to explore prompt engineering techniques.

To maximize the effectiveness of a GPT, it’s crucial to ask questions in a clear and precise manner. Crafting well-defined prompts can significantly enhance the quality of the responses you receive. Additionally, you can use the GPT itself to help refine your prompts for better results.

### Act-Review-Optimize-Ask is a prompt technique to use Gen AI to create awesome prompts.

Template Prompt: 
Act as a prompt engineer. Review the following prompt for me. Optimize it to make it better. Ask me any questions that you have to make it better.###Your Prompt goes here

This is how you would normally write a prompt: 
```
I want to increase my opportunities for success as a college student. Could you tell me how Gen AI can help me with that goal?
```
Instead write the prompt like this: 
```
Act as a prompt engineer. Review the following prompt for me. Optimize it to make it better. Ask me any questions that you have to make it better.###I want to increase my opportunities for success as a college student. Could you tell me how Gen AI can help me with that goal?
